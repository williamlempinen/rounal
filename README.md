### Features

- **Filter logs by priority** (emerg, alert, err, etc.)
- **Navigate easily** with Vim-style or arrow keybindings
- **Copy (yank) logs to clipboard**
- **Customizable colors and behavior** via config
- **Async fetching of journal entries** for better performance

### Motivation

I found that finding and reading logs generated by `systemd` can sometimes be a bit overwhelming. This project tries to solve this with a user interface, that supports some `Vim`-like movements (future work).

This project serve as my submission to my university course, `Modern user interfaces, 2025`. Also, I have recently found Rust to be a interesting programming language and wanted to learn it by creating a project. 

### Installation

##### Prerequisites

- A Unix system with `systemd` and `journalctl` available.
- Rust and Cargo (`rustup` recommended): https://rustup.rs
- A terminal that supports UTF-8 characters.
- `sudo` commands supported, i.e. the program will fetch `journalctl` entries with the command:

`sudo journalctl -u <selected-service> -r -p <1-7>`
